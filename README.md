1. What’s a REST API?
It's an architectural style for web services, built on HTTP, where clients and servers communicate using operations like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and exchange structured data (typically JSON/XML)

2. REST Principles Explained

    Stateless Communication: Each request contains all necessary info—servers don’t store session context.

    Uniform Interface: Standard, predictable operations on resources.

    Cacheable Responses: Encourages faster, scalable systems.

    Layered System Structure: Architecture can be composed of multiple layers (load balancers, proxies, servers) without client awareness.

3. HTTP Methods & Use Cases

    GET → Retrieve resources

    POST → Create new resources

    PUT → Update existing resources

    DELETE → Remove resources
    Explains when and why each method is used.

4. Designing APIs Effectively
Focus on resource structure, HTTP status codes, error messaging, versioning (e.g. /v1/users), and endpoint organization (use nouns, not verbs).

5. Tools & Best Practices

    Use Postman for testing API requests.

    Define schemas and documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI.

    Implement pagination, filtering, and authentication (e.g. via API keys or OAuth).
